        <p><strong>Origins</strong></p>
            <p>A topic of debate, there are several beliefs to the origin of the paisley. One theory is that it was born in Ancient Babylon<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup><span style="line-height: 107%;">[1]</span></sup></a>; another, with more evidence, is that it first appeared in the late 9th century in the Haji Piyada Mosque, also known as Noh Gumbad Mosque. A seemingly more popular one is that this teardrop-shaped symbol originated in Persia as a symbol of Zorastrian religion. Zoroastrianism is an ancient religion dating back to the 5th century BCE, where it first was recorded; followers believe in one supreme being, Ahura Mazda, and that how good a person is determines their fate after death. A symbol of this religion was the cypress tree representing (eternal) life given that cypress trees tend to have an enduring, lasting life. First used on shawls created in Kashmir, it quickly spread across other Asian and Indian countries and was especially popular during the Mughal period after the conquer of Kashmir<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><sup><span style="line-height: 107%;">[2]</span></sup></a>; although the Mughals themselves were Muslim, Emperor Akbar and the Mughals were famous for grand monuments like the Taj Mahal and so after the takeover he chose to further develop production.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><sup><span style="line-height: 107%;">[3]</span></sup></a> It was also believed to have potentially been created in Egypt, specifically Akhmim in the 6th-8th century as silk garments adorned with the paisley were found. This area was under Sassanian control at the time and at intervals was part of the Persian empire<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><sup><span style="line-height: 107%;">[4]</span></sup></a>, so likely it might have been influenced by Persia or vice versa.</p>
            <p><strong>Imagery</strong></p>
            <p>The cypress combined with a floral spray created the paisley, originally known as &ldquo;<em>boteh jeghah&rdquo; </em>and called a &ldquo;<em>buta&rdquo; or &ldquo;boteh&rdquo; (</em>bush/cluster or flower bud). The Sassanid dynasty was in power at the time of the paisley origination, which officially named Zoroastrianism as its religion; the motif could be found on silk tissues during this period, which is why some believe that it a stylized cypress tree.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><sup><span style="line-height: 107%;">[5]</span></sup></a> Amongst different cultures, many different objects come to mind when viewing the paisley. It is commonly referred to as a kidney or teardrop shape, sometimes even as a tadpole. In American history it was referred to as a &ldquo;Persian Pickle&rdquo; in other cultures it was thought to be of a mango shape, which is a symbol of fertility in India<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><sup><span style="line-height: 107%;">[6]</span></sup></a>. In Tamil, a mango is for the powerful as it&rsquo;s an exotic food and they consider the paisley as a symbol of peace and prosperity.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><sup><span style="line-height: 107%;">[7]</span></sup></a> &nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Spread of Paisley</strong></p>
            <p>The East India Company brought the Kashmir shawls to Europe starting in the 18th and century and while wildly popular there, they were also extremely expensive, so it quickly started being reproduced by other textile shops. One main hub for these reproductions was the town of Paisley in Renfrewshire, Scotland where the westernized name of this pattern was derived from. Paisley was a major creator of silk at the time and it so happened that during this time of popularity, the Napoleonic Wars were transpiring and trade was interrupted causing unemployment. Therefore Paisley was sitting on a number of experienced workers who could create this design and started producing it at a fast pace.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><sup><span style="line-height: 107%;">[8]</span></sup></a> The paisley design spread to the United States after the Beatles visited India and brought the paisley back, it even went as far as John Lennon&rsquo;s Rolls-Royce being painted a paisley pattern. Aside from the rock fans, the motif also became trendy in the world of gay men who used the paisley as a beacon to indicate sexual leanings and boundaries.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><sup><span style="line-height: 107%;">[9]</span></sup></a></p>
            <p><strong>In the Real World</strong></p>
            <p>As all trends do, the paisley pattern starting to die out around the end of the 19th century. This was due to the overproduction and ease of access to the design and it was not seen as an elite item to have as it once had been. Unsurprisingly, around the 1950s and 1960s when the culture leaned towards a looser, more free vibe, there was a paisley revival. This surge was helped tremendously musicians such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stone when the culture was more psychedelic and zeitgeist than it was in earlier centuries so this era saw lots of flamboyant paisley prints on ties, shirts, and more.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><sup><span style="line-height: 107%;">[10]</span></sup></a> Following the times, paisley was associated with rebelling during the 60s in stark contrast to other more restrained fashion. Furthering this idea of dissent is the common usage of paisley on bandanas, which are commonly associated with cowboys and, later on, gang members as a means to disguise their faces.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><sup><span style="line-height: 107%;">[11]</span></sup></a> In contrast, a less well-received instance of the paisley print was in the 2010 Winter Olympics where the Azerbaijan team wore pants with a paisley print.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><sup><span style="line-height: 107%;">[12]</span></sup></a></p>
