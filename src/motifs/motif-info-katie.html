        <p>The paisley motif has been incorporated in designs around the world for years and is likely older than one would think. Although a topic of debate, common speculation is that the design originated in Persia as a symbol for the Zoroastrian religion. Zoroastrianism is an ancientreligion dating back to the 5th century BCE, where it first was recorded; followers believe in one supreme being, Ahura Mazda, and that how good a person is determines their fate after death. A symbol of this religion was the cypress tree representing (eternal) life given that cypress trees tend to have an enduring, lasting life. The cypress combined with a floral spray created the paisley, originally known as <em>“boteh jeghah”</em> and called a <em>“buta”</em> or <em>“boteh”</em> (bush or cluster) in Persia.The pattern was printed on shawls created in Kashmir and pervaded many other Asian and Indian countries before, as with many other items, being introduced to the East via the Silk Road. The East India Company brought these shawls to Europe starting in the 18th and centuryand while wildly popular there, they were also extremely expensive, so it quickly started being reproduced by other textile shops. One main hub for these reproductions was the town of Paisley in Renfrewshire, Scotland where the westernized name of this pattern was derived from,which was a major creator of silk at the time. It so happened that during this time of popularity, the Napoleonic Wars were transpiring and trade was interrupted causing unemployment, so Paisley was sitting on a number of experienced workers who could create this design.

          <p>As all trends do, the paisley pattern starting to die out around the end of the 19th century. This was due to the overproduction and ease of access to the motif and therefore it wasnot seen as an elite item to have as it once had been.The paisley revival occurred, somewhat unsurprisingly, around the 1950s and 1960s when the culture leaned towards a looser, more free vibe. This surge was helped tremendously musicians such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, this time the theme was more psychedelic and zeitgeist than it was in earlier centuries and this era saw lots of flamboyant paisley prints on ties, shirts, and more. Following the times, paisley was associated with rebelling during the 60s in stark contrast to other more restrained fashion. Furthering this idea of dissent is the common usage of paisley on bandanas, which are commonly associated with cowboys and, later on, gang members as a means to disguise their faces. In contrast, a less well-received instance of the paisley print was in the 2010 Winter Olympics where the Azerbaijan team wore pants with a paisley print.
