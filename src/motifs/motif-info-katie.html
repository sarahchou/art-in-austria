        <p>The paisley motif has been incorporated in designs around the world for years and is likely older than one
          would think. Although a topic of debate, common speculation is that the design originated in Persia as a
          symbol for the Zoroastrian religion. Zoroastrianism is an ancientreligion dating back to the 5th century BCE,
          where it first was recorded; followers believe in one supreme being, Ahura Mazda, and that how good a person
          is determines their fate after death. A symbol of this religion was the cypress tree representing (eternal)
          life given that cypress trees tend to have an enduring, lasting life. The cypress combined with a floral spray
          created the paisley, originally known as <em>“boteh jeghah”</em> and called a <em>“buta”</em> or
          <em>“boteh”</em> (bush or cluster) in Persia.The pattern was printed on shawls created in Kashmir and pervaded
          many other Asian and Indian countries before, as with many other items, being introduced to the East via the
          Silk Road. The East India Company brought these shawls to Europe starting in the 18th and centuryand while
          wildly popular there, they were also extremely expensive, so it quickly started being reproduced by other
          textile shops. One main hub for these reproductions was the town of Paisley in Renfrewshire, Scotland where
          the westernized name of this pattern was derived from,which was a major creator of silk at the time. It so
          happened that during this time of popularity, the Napoleonic Wars were transpiring and trade was interrupted
          causing unemployment, so Paisley was sitting on a number of experienced workers who could create this design.
        </p>
        <p>As all trends do, the paisley pattern starting to die out around the end of the 19th century. This was due to
          the overproduction and ease of access to the motif and therefore it wasnot seen as an elite item to have as it
          once had been.The paisley revival occurred, somewhat unsurprisingly, around the 1950s and 1960s when the
          culture leaned towards a looser, more free vibe. This surge was helped tremendously musicians such as the
          Beatles and the Rolling Stones, this time the theme was more psychedelic and zeitgeist than it was in earlier
          centuries and this era saw lots of flamboyant paisley prints on ties, shirts, and more. Following the times,
          paisley was associated with rebelling during the 60s in stark contrast to other more restrained fashion.
          Furthering this idea of dissent is the common usage of paisley on bandanas, which are commonly associated with
          cowboys and, later on, gang members as a means to disguise their faces. In contrast, a less well-received
          instance of the paisley print was in the 2010 Winter Olympics where the Azerbaijan team wore pants with a
          paisley print.

        <p>While paisley is a popular design that seems to cycle in and out of fashion, it is one that seems to prevail
          over and over. Perhaps this is because to different people it stands for something different. For example,
          aside from its many names and disputed origins, it was also considered a symbol of fertility by Indians and
          viewed as a teardrop shape that could be like a mango, a tadpole, or a kidney bean depending on who is asked.
          Popular among men and women, paisley on a tie points towards the groin and has a powerful effect as opposed to

        <h6>Origins</h6>
        <p>A topic of debate, there are several beliefs to the origin of the paisley. One theory is that it was born in
          Ancient Babylon1; another, with more evidence, is that it first appeared in the late 9th century in the Haji
          Piyada Mosque, also known as Noh Gumbad Mosque. A seemingly more popular one is that this teardrop-shaped
          symbol originated in Persia as a symbol of Zorastrian religion. Zoroastrianism is an ancient religion dating
          back to the 5th century BCE, where it first was recorded; followers believe in one supreme being, Ahura Mazda,
          and that how good a person is determines their fate after death. A symbol of this religion was the cypress
          tree representing (eternal) life given that cypress trees tend to have an enduring, lasting life. First used
          on shawls created in Kashmir, it quickly spread across other Asian and Indian countries and was especially
          popular during the Mughal period after the conquer of Kashmir2; although the Mughals themselves were Muslim,
          Emporer Akbar and the Mughals were famous for grand monuments like the Taj Mahal and so after the takeover he
          chose to further develop production.3It was also believed to have potentially been created in Egypt,
          specifically Akhmim in the 6th-8thcentury as silk garments adorned with the paisley were found. This area was
          under Sassanian control at the time and at intervals was part of the Persian empire4, so likely it might have
          been influenced by Persia or vice versa.</p>
        <h6>Imagery</h6>
        <p>The cypress combined with a floral spray created the paisley, originally known as “boteh jeghah” and called a
          “buta” or “boteh” (bush/cluster or flower bud). The Sassanid dynasty was inpower at the time of the paisley
          origination, which officially named Zoroastrianism as its religion;the motif could be found on silk tissues
          during this period, which is why some believe that it a stylized cypress tree.5 Amongst different cultures,
          many different objects come to mind when viewing the paisley. It is commonly referred to as a kidney or
          teardrop shape, sometimes even as a tadpole. In American history it was referred to as a “Persian Pickle” in
          other cultures it was thought to be of a mango shape, which is a symbol of fertility in India6. In Tamil, a
          mango is for the powerful as it’s an exotic food and they consider the paisley as a symbol of peace and
          prosperity.</p>
        <h6>Spread of Paisley</h6>
        <p>The East India Company brought the Kashmir shawls to Europe starting in the 18th and century and while wildly
          popular there, they were also extremely expensive, so it quickly started being reproduced by other textile
          shops. One main hub for these reproductions was the town of Paisley in Renfrewshire, Scotland where the
          westernized name of this pattern was derived from.Paisley was a major creator of silk at the time and it so
          happened that during this time of popularity, the Napoleonic Wars were transpiring and trade was interrupted
          causing unemployment. Therefore Paisley was sitting on a number of experienced workers who could create this
          design and started producing it at a fast pace.8 The paisley design spread to the United States after the
          Beatles visited India and brought the paisley back, it even went as far as John Lennon’s Rolls-Royce being
          painted a paisley pattern. Aside from the rock fans, the motif also became trendy in the world of gay men who
          used the paisley as a beacon to indicate sexual leanings and boundaries.</p>
        <h6>In the Real World</h6>
        <p>As all trends do, the paisley pattern starting to die out around the end of the 19th century. This was due to
          the overproduction and ease of access to the design and it was not seen as an elite item to have as it once
          had been. Unsurprisingly, around the 1950s and 1960s when the culture leaned towards a looser, more free vibe,

          lots offlamboyant paisley prints on ties, shirts, and more.10 Following the times, paisley was associatedwith
          rebelling during the 60s in stark contrast to other more restrained fashion. Furthering this idea of dissent
          is the common usage of paisley on bandanas, which are commonly associated with cowboys and, later on, gang
