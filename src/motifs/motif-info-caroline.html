        <p>The meander pattern motif is defined as a continuous line that is repeated asa pattern, typically found as a
          decorative border on tile, vases, textiles, borders around illustrations, and buildings. It is also sometimes
          referred to as “Greek key” or “Greek fret.” Though widely connected to the ancient Greeks and sub-sequent
          historical classical revivals in art and architecture, the geometric simplicity and replicability of the motif
          almost ensured that it would be “invented” by cultures across the world. </p>
        <h6>Historical Use</h6>
        <p>The word “meander” derives from the Greek “Maíandros,” their name for theMeander River in present-day
          Turkey. The winding nature of the river gives meaning to the modern word “meander,” which means “to wander a
          windingcourse.” The meander pattern lends itself to these definitions, as it is identified by a continuous
          line that winds around itself in a linear pattern.</p>
        <p>Ancient Greece and Rome: Though found in several cultures around the globe, the meander motif is most heavily
          associated with the ancient Greeks, who adorned such famous architectural works as the Parthenon, the Ara
          Pacis, and the Temple of Marsi. The motif has been found on countless archeological finds from vases to
          textiles. It was often found as a border to Greek, friezes, orlong, narrow bands of sculpture found on
          architectural worksii. Figure 2 shows a close of example of a frieze.</p>
        <p>This motif was also one of the popular motifs adopted by artists and architects paying tribute to the
          classics; during the Renaissance, in the art nouveau movement, and countless other examples from around the
          world.</p>
        <p>China: The meander motif can also be found in Chinese decoration, in combination with other motifs such as
          lotus scroll, forming a “floral meander”iii (Figure 2).</p>
        <p>Mesoamerica: Meander-like motifs have been identified in what is referred to as “Early-Middle Post classic
          Aztec” archaeologic finds (ceramics, architecture)iv. These designs are described as possibly holding the
          philosophical meaning ofreciprocal motion and balance, thus bringing that balance to the objects the Figure 3:

          motif was portrayed onv In figure 3, you can see that they are slightly varied from the Greek meander. Here
          the motions are still continuous, but jagged, perhaps from the rocks they are formed with. Nevertheless, they
          use similar repeat rules to the Greeks.</p>
        <h6>Meaning</h6>
        <p>Spiritual/Philosophical: The meander motif has held parallel representative meaning across the cultures that
          have used it. In Greece and Rome, it symbolized unity and infinity because of the continuous line aspect of
          the pattern. As mentioned above, the Aztec people are believed to have regarded it as a symbol of balance and
          reciprocal motion. Some accounts have even connected the meander motif to rotational motifs found in ancient
          Chinese and other Asian cultures. György Darvas made the connection between the rotational motifs represented
          by fish chasing their own tails (and later the yin yang symbol, which symbolized the unity between the
          opposing Tao and Confucian philosophies) and whirlpool motifs in Crete that went on to transform from
          rotational to translational, which resembled what we know as the meander motifvi. This connection elicits an
          unintentional unity between the two cultures, and gives more significance to the two patterns.</p>
        <p>Geometry/Grammar: The visual simplicity of the meander motif lends question to the significance of it in the
          contexts of geometry, recursion, individual artistic influence, and design process. John S Gero and Mary Lou
          Mahler explore these questions in Computational and Cognitive Models of Creative Design VviiI. They conclude
          the geometric rules that govern meander motifs have significance that goes beyond surface aesthetic, and that
          these design are not random, but follow sets of rules that are also used in variations of the motif. </p>
        <p>They also discovered that different forms, rules, and variations were specific to not only region and time
          period, but individual painters and artisans that used this motif in their workviii. This is testament to the
          notion that simple and ubiquitous motifs, as this one, can be just as artistically relevant as
          representational forms, and are of stylistic importance. </p>
