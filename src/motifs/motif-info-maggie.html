        <p>The Thunderbird is a mythological creature of North American indigenous peoples. The Thunderbird appears in the art and legends of many different native cultures across America, mainly those of the Pacific Northwest Coast native groups, but also those of the Southwest, East Coast, Great Lakes, and Great Plains groups. It appears often as a motif in the artwork and craftsmanship of these cultures. The Thunderbird has since been spread into many regions of contemporary American culture, as its name has been used in the automotive industry (the Ford Thunderbird), the sports industry (the Seattle Thunderbirds, a minor league hockey team), the military (the United States Air Force Thunderbirds, an air demonstration squadron akin to the Blue Angels), etc.</p>
        <p><strong>History and Cultural Significance</strong></p>
        <p>In almost all Native American cultural canons that include it, the Thunderbird is a symbol of power, protection, and strength, and is often believed to create storms. His wings are said to create thunderclaps as they flap, and he can shoot lightning from his eyes or throw it with his talons. He is also said to be able to transform into a human by opening up his head like a mask and taking off his feathers.</p>
        <p>In the Pacific Northwest Coast cultures in particular, the inclusion of the Thunderbird in the crest of a chief is a mark of high-rank and is only worn by the most powerful and prestigious chiefs. The main mythology of the Thunderbird in the oral histories of the Pacific Northwest Coast native tribes involves a story where the Killer Whale scares all of the salmon that the people were going to eat out of the bay, and upon discovering that the people were starving, the Thunderbird scooped up the Killer Whale and carried him back out to sea. Other instances of the Thunderbird in mythology depict him as aiding in the hunting of whales, using two lightning snakes with the heads of wolves that he keeps under his wings and uses as tools or weapons. These snakes were often painted onto canoes for this reason.</p>
        <p>In Algonquian culture, from the Atlantic Coast, Northeast Canada, and the Great Lakes area, the Thunderbird was said to rule over the upper-world, while the serpent rules under the under-world. The Thunderbird is also said to cause thunder by flapping its wings, and cause lightning when it throws lightning bolts at the under-world creatures. In the Ojibwe tribe in particular within the Algonquian group, the Thunderbird was believed to punish humans who act immorally, while the Menominee tribe believed that the Thunderbird controlled the rain and hail and were messengers of the Sun (the highest power or god within their faith and mythology).</p>
        <p><strong>Appearance in Art and Craftsmanship</strong></p>
        <p>In Northwest Coast depictions of the Thunderbird in totem poles, the Thunderbird is always portrayed with his wings outstretched at the top of the pole as a thanks for helping the people overcome food shortages and is also usually depicted with the Killer Whale clutched in his talons. The Thunderbird is depicted very similarly to the eagle, except for the two curved horns on his head.</p>
        <p>Northwest Coast art is done in a particular style called formline art, which uses three particular types of forms as building blocks to create depictions of animals and mythological creatures such as the Thunderbird, as well as abstract works. These three forms are called ovoids, U-forms, and S-forms. Ovoids are shapes that look like ovular rings and act as visual centers, while u-forms create a U-like shape and are usually used to show movement or direction, such as for wings, tails, fins and feathers. Then, there are S-forms, which look like Ss. These shapes can then be combined and modified to create inner structures, or to outline a form. Formline is the main style of work used in paintings, totem poles, and other carvings or engravings. Typically, the only colors used are red and black, while some of the original material is left exposed.</p>
        <p>Art from the Algonquian tribes usually depicts the Thunderbird with an X shaped form, ranging from only Xs to actual, fully-realized birds. The X-like forms are said to represent the intersection between the upper and under worlds.</p>
        <p>While the most prominent inclusions of the Thunderbird as a motif in native art/craftsmanship is in totem poles of the Northwest Coast tribes, he is also historically depicted in jewelry, bentwood boxes and canoe boxes, bags and baskets, masks, canoes, canoe paddles, horns, bows, clubs and batons, and miscellaneous carvings, though as time has passed he has also been depicted in prints, paintings, sculptures, and other art forms as contemporary Native American artists have begun to translate their historical artistic culture into more western forms.</p>
