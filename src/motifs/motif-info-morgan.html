        <p>Originating in the coastal regions of Japan, the Matsu black pine(or &ldquo;Pinus Thunbergii&rdquo; [<a href="https://gardenerdy.com/japanese-pine-tree"><span style="color: #1155cc;">1</span></a>]) is a pine tree that is widely planted around the country of Japan. With dark colored bark and pine needles, the Matsu is known for endurance, adaptability, and longevity. The tree has year-round foliage, and the trees&rsquo; branches can heal themselves through the resin they produce over their scars. Matsu trees can grow to a height of 40 meters, and their rugged, irregular pyramid shape can serve as boundary markers and hedges, used to stabilize shorelines and as a windbreak.</p>
        <p>Frequently used for bonsai trees, Matsu are very adaptable to their environments, and can be trained in many ways. The tree itself has been used for lumber and construction, production of gourmet mushrooms, and the production of calligraphy ink. The Matsu is an iconic cultural symbol, appearing prominently in Japanese gardens, literature, and art [<a href="https://www.seattlejapanesegarden.org/blog/2019/3/25/pine-trees-part-two-matsu-the-pines-of-japan"><span style="color: #1155cc;">2</span></a>].</p>
        <p><strong>Origins and Cultural Significance</strong></p>
        <p>Pine trees have contributed to Japanese life as far back as the 5th century. Prior to the Edo period (1600-1867), pine trees and branches were a popular choice of decoration for samurai on their armor and katana due to associations with masculinity. [<a href="http://ganbarunokai.it/matsu%20pine%20meaning.html"><span style="color: #1155cc;">3</span></a>] The Japanese word &ldquo;matsu&rdquo; translates to &ldquo;waiting for the soul of a god to descend from heaven,&rdquo; with its history stemming from an ancient Shinto belief that gods ascended to Heaven on a pine tree [<a href="http://ganbarunokai.it/matsu%20pine%20meaning.html"><span style="color: #1155cc;">3</span></a>].</p>
        <p>As recent as the 21st century, the Matsu tree has maintained its cultural significance to the people of Japan. In March 2011, the Great East Earthquake and tsunami devastated the city of Rikunzentakata, destroying a forest of nearly 70,000 pine trees. Following the disaster, one lone pine tree stood in the forest, becoming a national symbol of resilience and determination in Northeast Japan [<a href="http://ganbarunokai.it/matsu%20pine%20meaning.html"><span style="color: #1155cc;">3</span></a>]. As symbols of longevity and abundance, matsu imagery contain energy for strength and a long life.</p>
        <p><strong>Textiles and Fashion </strong></p>
        <p>In Japanese culture, motifs of natural objects and plants are used as communicators of meaning. Images and motifs used to decorate artefacts are not meant to be realistic, with simplified designs holding a heavy significance [<a href="http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/j/japanese-art-and-design-themes/"><span style="color: #1155cc;">4</span></a>].</p>
        <p>The motif of the Matsu tree is often heavily stylized, often mimicking a cloud-like shape, featuring unnatural colors, and appear to be floating. The pyramidal shape of the Matsu motif is featured in many textiles for traditional and artistic purposes. For example, Japanese kimonos often feature the motif. The richest source for kimono motifs comes from the natural world. The Matsu motif would often be found on more formal kimonos due to its strong significance.</p>
        <p>The Matsu is often paired with other motifs from the natural world including bamboo, blossoms, cranes, and other natural beings. In addition to other motifs, pine, bamboo and plum blossoms are known as "three friends of winter". The three motifs that can withstand cold weather signify longevity, perseverance, and renewal. [<a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/kimono"><span style="color: #1155cc;">5</span></a>]&nbsp; It is due to this that the three motifs, including the Matsu, are more often worn during winter or New Year&rsquo;s.</p>
