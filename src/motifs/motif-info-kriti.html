        <p>Translated from French, <em>fleur </em>means &lsquo;flower&rsquo; and
          <em>lys</em> means &lsquo;lily&rsquo;. The rather redundantly named
          Fleur de Lys is a motif principally associated with European monarchy,
          but also can be found in the history of places with their roots tied in
          France, such as Louisiana and Quebec. Contrary to its name the
          symmetrically stylised <em>image</em> is not derived from any kind of
          lily, but rather from the <em>Iris Pseurdacorus, </em>or the yellow
          iris. It was among the four most popular symbols used in European coats
          of arms, the other three being the cross, the eagle, and the lion. <a
          href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span style="line-height:
          107%;">[1]</span></a> Even now, the Fleur de Lys remains a popular
          decorative motif, and divorces itself further its ties to stand alone as
          the years go on.</p> <p><strong>Origins</strong></p> <p>The origins of
            the Fleur de Lys are not so much actively disputed as they are simply
            murky. As with most symbols adopted by European monarchies, the Fleur de
            Lys (prior to even its naming) can be traced to Christianity and
            hagiographic legends. One version of this legend has Clotilde, the wife
            of the Merovingian king Clovis (466-511), making her usual prayer with a
            nearby saint when an angel appears before her. The angel instructs her
            to replace her husband&rsquo;s three crescents (or toads, according to
            the version) with three golden lilies, which adorned his shield as the
            fleurs de lis known today and served to symbolise his conversion to
            Christianity. Another legend places the adoption of the symbol at the
            battle of Vouill&eacute; in 507, where the view of a doe crossing a ford
            surrounded by irises allowed Clovis to recognise the iris&rsquo;s (whose
            rhizomes contribute to the stabilisation of mud flats and riverbanks)
            sign of safe passage for his army, thus adopting the flower as a symbol
            of victory and thus that of the king of Franks. <a href="#_ftn2"
            name="_ftnref2"><span style="line-height: 107%;">[2]</span></a></p>
            <p>Regardless of the nature of legends, more concrete history of the
              flower can be traced to the 700s. The base of the north-west-most
              columns of the Basilica of Saint-Denis, built around the beginning of
              the reign of Charlemagne, is referred as the &ldquo;Fleur de Lys
              base&rdquo;, as despite its ruined state two of its faces can be
              observed to be decorated in tri-petal flowers.<a href="#_ftn3"
              name="_ftnref3"> <span style="line-height: 107%;">[3]</span></a> Christ
              in the Godescalc Evangelistary, completed in 783, is also surrounded by
              these same flowers, as seen in figure 2. Over the next few centuries, as
              is the norm, this Carolingian practice of three-pronged ornamentation
              was adopted by its surrounding nations&mdash;observe Edgar the
              Peaceful&rsquo;s (English king of the Mercians, Northumbrians, and the
              West Saxons in the 900s) crown in figure 1.</p> <p><strong>Louis VII and
                the French Monarchy</strong></p> <p>The symbol was tossed around
                  throughout the 700s onwards, but the Fleur de Lys was truly cemented as
                  a symbol of the French monarchy under Louis VII&mdash;it was he who
                  coined the term <em>Fleur de Lys </em>around 1160, as despite its
                  redundancy and slight inaccuracy it was, in old French, phonetically
                  close to &ldquo;Flor de Loys&rdquo; which denoted it <em>his </em>flower
                  (&lsquo;Loys&rsquo; <span style="font-family:
                  Wingdings;">&agrave;</span> &lsquo; Roi Louis&rsquo; [King Louis]). As
                  is well <span >known, royal colours at the time were purples, blues, and
                    reds, as these were considerably more difficult and permanent dyes than
                    the earthy plant colours more common to peasants. The pattern of the
                    flowers over deep blue was thus reserved solely for the reigning
                    monarch, and at least one depiction of every successive king will have
                    them wearing such robes. Otherwise, the motif was quickly popularised
                    and found its way on to clothes, paintings, monuments, and money
                    [Walters studies these coins and notes that their mintage signified the
                    current state of the monarchy in that the fleur was seen in conjunction
                    with the symbols of other nobles married into the family depending on
                    the current reign<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"> <span
                      style="line-height: 107%;">[4]</span></a>], and during the colonial era,
                      spread to other continents to France&rsquo;s African colonies and what
                      was then Indochina. It should also be noted that it was also a symbol to
                      brand prostitutes with on either their shoulders, chests, or behinds as
                      a mark of condemnation, thus the symbol carried honour only on
                      <em>objects, </em>and not the skin.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">
                        <span style="line-height: 107%;">[5]</span></a></span></p>
                        <p>Unfortunately for present historians, during the overthrowing of the
                          monarchy many works and monuments sporting the symbol were destroyed and
                          its importance for preservation has been rendered to nil, especially
                          with the French adoption of the tri-colour flag.</p> <p>However, as was
                            first mentioned, the fleur-de-lys (though perhaps not by that name) was
                            popular outside of France far before Louis VII. Its use as a decorative
                            ornament in other parts of Europe persisted even alongside Louis&rsquo;s
                            claim. For example, the Spanish flat-point lace design seen in Figure 8
                            was thrown during the renaissance period.<a href="#_ftn6"
                            name="_ftnref6"><span style="line-height: 107%;">[6]</span></a></p>
                            <p><strong>North America</strong></p> <p>Louisiana was under French
                              control as a district of New France for a considerable amount of time
                              during the eighteenth-nineteenth century before being sold to the United
                              States by Napoleon in 1803. This French cultural heritage is highly
                              celebrated from language to festivities and is also evident in the
                              prevalence of the Fleur de Lys motif. Their flag sports it, many of
                              their hotels and other businesses integrate it into either name,
                              d&eacute;cor or both, and it will be seen on most gates and fences. The
                              note about skin persists, however&mdash;here, the fleur brand was once
                              used to condemn slaves who tried to escape. <a href="#_ftn7"
