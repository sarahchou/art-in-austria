                <p>A mascaron is a sculptural representation of a head that is used as ornamental decoration
                    inarchitecture, often above windows or doorways. The term “mascaron” comes from Latin“mascus”,
                    meaning “head” or “face”.</p>
                <p>As an architectural motif, mascarons can be traced back to ancient Egypt and thepre-Colombian era.
                    Mascarons in Italy date back to pre-Roman times, and have been present inEuropean architecture ever
                    since. Most mascarons exist as anonymous artwork, while few havebeen claimed to specific artists.
                    The most recent movement to heavily feature mascarons wasthe Beaux Arts movement. </p>
                <p>The mascaron motif originates from the mask, an artificial hollow face intended to conceal orgive an
                    alternate identity to the wearer. Masks have been used throughout history for protection,disguise,
                    performance, entertainment, and use in ritual or ceremony. Similarly, mascarons existin multiple
                    forms in order to serve many varying uses or purposes.</p>
                <h6>Mascaron Forms and Meanings</h6>
                <p>Women: Women are commonly used as motifs for mascarons around the world. European femalemascarons are
                    presented as beautiful and mysterious, while Russian female mascaronssymbolize purity. Many are
                    thought to represent Greek goddess Hera, symbolizing protection ofthe family, hearth, and home.</p>
                <p>Grotesque: Grotesque mascarons are composed of a combination of human, animal, and plant
                    features,often to take the shape of an expressionistic monster. In the sixth and seventh
                    centuriesgrotesque mascarons were built with the intention to ward off evil, but they eventually
                    evolvedinto a more caricatured design that served a solely decorative purpose. They are most
                    commonin Gothic architecture.</p>
                <p>Green Man: The Green Man motif is a human, generally male, form surrounded by or composed of
                    leavesand greenery. It symbolizes the rebirth of nature, and is commonly found as a
                    decorativeornament.</p>
                <p>Medusa Head: In Greek mythology, Medusa was a snake-haired monster who into stone any being that
                    lookedinto her eyes. Therefore, traditionally the Medusa head motif was used to ward off evil.
                    Archaeicart represents the Medusa head as ugly and monstrous, yet later Greek ideations displayed
                    heras stern and beautiful. By the Modern and Renaissance eras, the Medusa head was seen asmainly
                    decorative.</p>
                <p>Skulls: The Skull or Death’s head is used to represent decay and death, and is generally found
                    onmonuments and tombs. It is generally represented by a front view or placed over two crossedbones.
                </p>
                <p>Animals: Animal mascarons commonly take the form of lions, tigers, panthers, goats, rams and
                    horses.Lions have been the most popular form of animal mascaron since the Crusades of the
                    12thcentury, symbolizing strength, protection, and majesty. The tiger and panther were used
                    inantique works, similarly symbolizing strength. Less adapted are oxen, pigs, dogs, foxes, stags,or
                    hares, which are typically used symbolically in connection to hunting.
                </p>
