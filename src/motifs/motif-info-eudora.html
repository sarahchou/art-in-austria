        <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Symbolic motifs have always played an important part in Japanese art and culture. For example, Mon, which are Japanese family crests were often used to identify a family. These symbols could be printed on clothing to distinguish clans or be incorporated into other fabrics such as curtains placed at the front door that would show which family lived in a certain household.</p>
<p>Traditional Japanese designs or “Wagara” are another example of symbolic motifs used in Japanese culture. They are traditional Japanese patterns created with the influence of painting and Chinese calligraphy. Each pattern has a meaning behind it giving the designs a story and history to build off of. Historically these patterns were used to make Kimonos and Yukatas (traditional and ceremonial Japanese attire). Today, these patterns have been translated into other products as well such as bags, clothes, pottery, etc. </p>
<p><strong>Chidori</strong><p>
<p>A common motif used when creating these patterns is Chidori or Plovers which are a migratory bird in Japan. They are often shown flying over waves. The waves are strong and powerful forces that the Chidori have to face which is why they are a symbol of perseverance and strength. Another meaning of the Chidori when they are shown in groups flying above the waves is that they have come together and are flying away from the waves, which is a metaphor for avoiding troubles.
