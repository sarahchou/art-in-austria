        <p>A courtyard is a roofless (or semi-roofless) area that is enclosed (or mostly enclosed) by buildings or walls. They are a hallmark of European architecture, and they are specifically central to both the physical layout of buildings and social life. Larger courtyards attract hundreds of people daily while smaller ones offer a quiet, communal outdoor space for the residents of the buildings that border it. A space safely enclosed from the outside world by four walls, courtyards offer a sense of intimacy without being stifling, as most open to the sky (or give the appearance of being open-air).</p>
        <p>Courtyards have been used in European architecture since antiquity (note: they were actually first recorded in Mesopotamia). Functionally, courtyards help regulate the temperature of the buildings around them, particularly in high heat, simultaneously protecting their inhabitants from the elements. They were prevalent in the Roman era, where each home had a courtyard called an <em>atrium, </em>which served as a social meeting-spot, but also had various functional roles &mdash; for example, as they were open to the sky, homeowners often had a well-like structure in their courtyards to collect rainwater. Larger courtyards in more public spaces commonly housed markets where people could go to buy or sell goods. Early Christian monasteries in the Medieval era used courtyards near their entrances &ldquo;as places for reading, study and seclusion&hellip; as well as for growing herbs for medicinal purposes&rdquo;, which, &ldquo;by association, [caused] courtyards [to be] incorporated into hospitals&rdquo;. Courtyards continued to be prevalent in the Renaissance Era by way of the &ldquo;palazzo design&rdquo; for family homes in Italy.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
        <p>Many dynastic monarchies built palaces with large courtyards, often with fountains or gardens, surrounded by gilded facades, as a way to display their wealth and power (see: Versailles, Schobrunn Palace, Buckingham Palace, the Grand Kremlin Palace, etc.). Today, the remnants of old courtyards can be seen all over Europe, both in buildings that have since been repurposed and those that have been preserved.</p>
        <p>There has been research done on the benefits of courtyard-style homes in terms of urban planning. Essentially, a courtyard allows for residences to share the same space instead of</p>
        <p>each residence having its own &ldquo;yard&rdquo;, with the same level of satisfaction with their &ldquo;outdoor space&rdquo;, which allows more residences to be built in a smaller plot of land.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> Further, domestic courtyards foster a sense of community between the residence of the buildings that border them, as they provide a communal space for them to gather and maintain together.</p>
        <p><strong>Courtyard&rsquo;s function in private space</strong></p>
        <p>The courtyard of a private home was often both the physical and social center of the home. As previously mentioned, it may house essentials such as a well or a fire/oven, but also, since courtyards sit in the center of the house and effectively border each room, residents would have to enter it at some point during the day. Depending on location and need, the courtyard can act &ldquo;as an extension of the kitchen during the [day] and as living room during the evening to entertain the guests&rdquo;. It is a space for family members to interact, encouraging a sense of kinship with the ones also able to access the courtyard, due to its visual and acoustical seclusion from the outside world. Furthermore, the geometry of the courtyard and it&rsquo;s surrounding walls equate to a much more temperate atmosphere within the courtyard than outside of it, cooling the home.</p>
        <p><strong>Courtyard&rsquo;s function in public space</strong></p>
        <p>The public courtyard functions much like a private one in terms of social interaction, but on a much grander scale. However, in contrast to private courtyards, public courtyards&rsquo; main role is to be a social meeting spot, as opposed to serving any functional purpose (i.e.: acting as a kitchen-extension). The public courtyard, lined with food or drink stalls, is an efficient setup for the public to mingle. A study at Hong Kong University showed that the contents and location of the courtyard affects the reaction people have to it. They studied two courtyards within the University: one&nbsp; near a busy entrance and a quieter one with a &ldquo;meditative garden&rdquo; outside the library. They found that the &ldquo;garden within a courtyard that [was] located normally at the entrance and the meditation garden found near the campus library, has specific purposes and [has] a differentiate pattern and landscape design. The meditation garden is better for [a] study environment, while the garden within [the] courtyard support public social interaction&rdquo;.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
