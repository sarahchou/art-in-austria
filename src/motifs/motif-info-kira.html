        <p>Translated from French, <em>fleur </em>means &lsquo;flower&rsquo; and <em>lys </em>means &lsquo;lily&rsquo;. The rather redundantly named Fleur de Lys is a motif principally associated with European monarchy, but also can be found in the history of places with their roots tied in France, such as Louisiana and Quebec. Contrary to its name the symmetrically stylised <em>image</em> is not derived from any kind of lily, but rather from the <em>Iris Pseurdacorus, </em>or the yellow iris. It was among the four most popular symbols used in European coats of arms, the other three being the cross, the eagle, and the lion. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span style="line-height: 107%;">[1]</span></a> Even now, the Fleur de Lys remains a popular decorative motif, and divorces itself further its ties to stand alone as the years go on.</p>
        <p><strong>Origins</strong></p>
        <p>The origins of the Fleur de Lys are not so much actively disputed as they are simply murky. As with most symbols adopted by European monarchies, the Fleur de Lys (prior to even its naming) can be traced to Christianity and hagiographic legends. One version of this legend has Clotilde, the wife of the Merovingian king Clovis (466-511), making her usual prayer with a nearby saint when an angel appears before her. The angel instructs her to replace her husband&rsquo;s three crescents (or toads, according to the version) with three golden lilies, which adorned his shield as the fleurs de lis known today and served to symbolise his conversion to Christianity. Another legend places the adoption of the symbol at the battle of Vouill&eacute; in 507, where the view of a doe crossing a ford surrounded by irises allowed Clovis to recognise the iris&rsquo;s (whose rhizomes contribute to the stabilisation of mud flats and riverbanks) sign of safe passage for his army, thus adopting the flower as a symbol of victory and thus that of the king of Franks.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">[2]</span></a></p>
        <p>Regardless of the nature of legends, more concrete history of the flower can be traced to the 700s. The base of the north-west-most columns of the Basilica of Saint-Denis, built around the beginning of the reign of Charlemagne, is referred as the &ldquo;Fleur de Lys base&rdquo;, as despite its ruined state two of its faces can be observed to be decorated in tri-petal flowers.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><span style="line-height: 107%;">[3]</span></a> Christ in the Godescalc Evangelistary, completed in 783, is also surrounded by these same flowers, as seen in figure 2. Over the next few centuries, as is the norm, this Carolingian practice of three-pronged ornamentation was adopted by its surrounding nations &ndash; observe Edgar the Peaceful&rsquo;s (English king of the Mercians, Northumbrians, and the West Saxons in the 900s) crown in figure 1.</p>
        <p><strong>Louis VII and the French Monarchy</strong></p>
        <p>The symbol was tossed around throughout the 700s onwards, but the Fleur de Lys was truly cemented as a symbol of the French monarchy under Louis VII &ndash; it was he who coined the term <em>Fleur de Lys </em>around 1160, as despite its redundancy and slight inaccuracy it was, in old French, phonetically close to &ldquo;Flor de Loys&rdquo; which denoted it <em>his </em>flower (&lsquo;Loys&rsquo; <span style="font-family: Wingdings;">&agrave;</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> &lsquo;Roi Louis&rsquo; [King Louis]). As is well </span><span >known, royal colours at the time were purples, blues, and reds, as these were considerably more difficult and permanent dyes than the earthy plant colours more common to peasants. The pattern of the flowers over deep blue was thus reserved solely for the reigning monarch, and at least one depiction of every successive king will have them wearing such robes. Otherwise, the motif was quickly popularised and found its way on to clothes, paintings, monuments, and money [Walters studies these coins and notes that their mintage signified the current state of the monarchy in that the fleur was seen in conjunction with the symbols of other nobles married into the family depending on the current reign<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><span style="line-height: 107%;">[4]</span></a>], and during the colonial era, spread to other continents to France&rsquo;s African colonies and what was then Indochina. It should also be noted that it was also a symbol to brand prostitutes with on either their shoulders, chests, or behinds as a mark of condemnation, thus the symbol carried honour only on <em>objects, </em>and not the skin.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">[5]</span></a></span></p>
        <p>Unfortunately for present historians, during the overthrowing of the monarchy many works and monuments sporting the symbol were destroyed and its importance for preservation has been rendered to nil, especially with the French adoption of the tri-colour flag.</p>
        <p>However, as was first mentioned, the fleur-de-lys (though perhaps not by that name) was popular outside of France far before Louis VII. Its use as a decorative ornament in other parts of Europe persisted even alongside Louis&rsquo;s claim. For example, the Spanish flat-point lace design seen in Figure 8 was thrown during the renaissance period.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><span style="line-height: 107%;">[6]</span></a></p>
        <p><strong>North America</strong></p>
        <p>Louisiana was under French control as a district of New France for a considerable amount of time during the eighteenth-nineteenth century before being sold to the United States by Napoleon in 1803. This French cultural heritage is highly celebrated from language to festivities and is also evident in the prevalence of the Fleur de Lys motif. Their flag sports it, many of their hotels and other businesses integrate it into either name, d&eacute;cor or both, and it will be seen on most gates and fences. The note about skin persists, however &ndash; here, the fleur brand was once used to condemn slaves who tried to escape.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><span style="line-height: 107%;">[7]</span></a></p>
