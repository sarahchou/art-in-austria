        <p>The Meander or Meandros originated in Ancient Greece and was very commonly used in the Geometric Period.  Meanders are common used elements in Greek and Roman art. The meander, also known as the Greek fret or the Greek key modern day, was named after the river Meander. The Ancient Meander River flowed from the highlands of southern Phrygia into the Aegean Sea, and was remembered for its exceptionally winding and twisting path.</p>
        <p>Some say the meander is one of the most important symbols in Ancient Greece. The way the lines are constantly interlocking and repeating make them seem endless. Symbolizing unity and infinity, this motif represents the eternal flow of things; sometimes signifying waves in their endless pattern. Pottery and vases along with other ancient Greek objects are often found with the meander motif used as decoration. These objects were created during the geometric period when the meander became very popular. The Geometric period marked the end of Greece’s dark age and lasted from 900-700 BCE. The name of this time period comes from the dominance of geometric motifs in vase paintings such as the meander.</p>
        <p>In one of its common forms, the meander is used as a decorative boarder of sorts. It is comprised of a series of right angled interlocking lines. This ‘pattern/ technique’ formed continuous spirals and maze like networks of broken and connected lines. The meander is often symbolically associated with labyrinth’s due to its maze like structure. Pottery objects with the meander motif on them were often given as wedding gifts, the motif symbolizing the everlasting bonds of friendship, love and devotion. While the pattern was often used in homes of the common people, many ancient Greek Temples incorporated the sign of meander. Another place itwas on armor, specifically the shield of Phillip of Macedon1 which is decorated with multiple symbols of meander.  The twisted pattern was also believed to mimic the serpent which is a symbol of healing and guardianship.</p>
        <p>While this motif is often found in museums and in some ancient architecture around the world, mainly Greece, it is a timeless design. Many traditional buildings in and around China still bear geometric designs almost identical to meanders. Even though the name originated from a Greek word, the meander can be seen worldwide in all aspects of life. For example, the Versacelogo2 which features the head of Medusa is encircled by the meander motif. Present day, this
          motif has remained popular in contemporary art and design and has been used with increasing frequencies in various domains. The artist Anni Albers uses the meander pattern in her screen print Orange Meander created in 19713 have always seen this pattern around and to me, it alwayssignified Greek history, or a connection to Greece. But now, I know how much more this motif truly stands for. Who would have thought such a simple geometric pattern comprised of continuous lines and ninety degree angles had so much meaning behind it.</p>
