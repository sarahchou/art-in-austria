        <p>The boteh (meaning ‘bush) is the shape of a teardrop with a curve at the end, making up the pattern known today as paisley. It originated in Persian culture and then spread to India where it is referred to as the buta (meaning ‘flower’). The motif originated as a depiction of the cypress tree, symbolizing eternity and life, and is usually seen in conjunction with other nature-based symbols.</p>
        <p>The earliest found siting of the boteh was in Akhmim, a city in northern Egypt, estimated to have come from the 6<sup>th</sup>&ndash;8<sup>th</sup> centuries. At this time, it manifested itself as the wings of mythological creatures, rather than forming a pattern of its own. The motif became quite popular amongst the Persian empire and India, its spread aided by the silk road, but its existence did not go beyond this region until the 17<sup>th</sup> century. It was at this time that Indian patterns began to grow in popularity amongst Europe, the boteh included, as they were viewed as exotic and difficult to attain. Paisley usually came in the form of shawls made of silk or cashmere. The East India Company, the main company responsible for exporting to Europe, was not able to produce enough product to keep up with the European demand, so Europe began producing these fabrics itself- particurarly in the Scottish town of Paisley, where it gets its contemporary name from. In recent years, paisley has seen a fresh rise in popularity, it&rsquo;s psychedelic elements popular with hippie culture, and remains common throughout Western culture today.
