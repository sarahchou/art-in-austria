            <h6>Origin</h6>
            <div>The stupa is a type of Buddhist monument which holds religious relics and serves as a place of</div>
            <div>worship. The stupa originated before Buddhism, and was typically a simple mound of earth</div>
            <div>containing ashes or remnants from the bodies of kings or leaders/teachers. These mounds of</div>
            <div>earth were often covered with stone to contain the relics. This tradition of a solid mound of earth
            </div>
            <div>surrounded by a protective covering remains in Buddhist traditions, although the subject they</div>
            <div>are meant to honor changes.</div>
            <div>While the Buddha was still alive, he asked for stupas to be built as a place of worship and</div>
            <div>meditation. He wanted the focus to be on reminding his followers of the Four Noble Truths and</div>
            <div>the goal of enlightenment instead of specifically honoring the Buddha himself. After the Buddha</div>
            <div>died, stupas were built at locations of important events during the Buddha&rsquo;s life, as well as
            </div>
            <div>across the Mauryan Dynasty (regions of modern-day India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan and</div>
            <div>Afghanistan). The Buddha asked for stupas to be built not only at locations important to his life</div>
            <div>so that more people would be reminded of his teachings. Originally, stupas were meant to hold</div>
            <div>the earthly remains of the Buddha, but eventually all of the Buddha&rsquo;s remains had been divided
            </div>
            <div>between stupas and the stupa&rsquo;s contents expanded to religious relics such as texts. Now,</div>
            <div>stupas exist all across the world as places for Buddhist followers to worship and meditate.</div>
            <h6>Structure</h6>
            <div>Stupas always consist of a solid earth mound, which contains the religious relics or remains of</div>
            <div>the Buddha, and some sort of outer covering. The basic structure of a Buddhist stupa includes</div>
            <div>three main parts: the square base, which represents the Buddha&rsquo;s legs as he is sitting in a</div>
            <div>meditative pose, the round middle portion, which represents his body, and the smaller top</div>
            <div>structure, which represents the Buddha&rsquo;s head. Different regions and time periods constructed
            </div>
            <div>different styles of stupas. These styles include that of The Great Stupa, built in Sanchi, India</div>
            <div>beginning in the 3rd century BCE which is shorter and more round or that of Phra Si Ratana</div>
            <div>Chedi built in Bangkok, Thailand in the 19th century, which is quite tall and completely covered</div>
            <div>in gold.</div>
            <h6>Worship</h6>
            <div>Regardless of their shape or covering, stupas were built as places of worship and remembrance</div>
            <div>of the Buddha&rsquo;s teachings. Since stupas are completely solid, Buddhist practitioners</div>
            <div>circumambulate, or walk around the structure instead of entering as one would a church or</div>
            <div>temple. This circulating movement represents the cycle of rebirth and helps the worshipper think</div>
            <div>of the process of enlightenment as a circular movement towards the stable center of the stupa.</div>
          </div>

        <section class="pdf_page" aria-label="Page 2">This circular movement also increases the worshipper&rsquo;s body
