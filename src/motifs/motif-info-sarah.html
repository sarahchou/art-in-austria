                <p>Ise-katagami is a Japanese craft using finely cut paper stencils to dye textiles. Cotton, silk, or
                    other cloths use katagamistencilsto make kimonos. These stencils havefascinatingmotifs because of
                    their repetitive patterns, which demonstrate the intricacies of Japanese design, as well as the
                    artists’precise fine-cutting techniques. </p>
                <p>Context and Description:
                    This stencil is part of a set of cards, and has a plant and mimasu interlacing
                    squares motif. The artist is anonymous, but it was created during the Edo period (1603- 1868). It is
                    part of the Asia Collection at the MAK Museum of Applied Arts in Vienna, Austria.
                </p>
                <p>History:
                    Stencils were known to be used since the Nara period (710-784 AD), and paper
                    stencils were later developed alongside the kimono. Ise-katagami refers to the towns in the Ise
                    province, which is where the craft originated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Production and Techniques:
                    Katagami are produced by highly trained craftspeople who carve out patterns on stencil or thin washi
                    paper. The designs are extremely intricate and fragile.
                    <p>There are four main knife carving techniques used to create katagami: tsukibori (push carving),
                        kiribori (drill carving), shimabori (stripe punching), or dōgubori (tool punching). One
                        craftsperson usually only specializes in one technique, as mastering multiple is quite
                        difficult. Each technique requires different carving knives and also results in different
                        patterns. Another technique, itoire (insertion of threads), is also used after the carving to
                        preserve the fragile stencil. This particular katagami was created using the push carving
                        tskuibori method combined with the itoire technique.
                    </p>
                    <p>Tsukibori requires the artist to cut through six layers of stencil paper, pushing the tip of the
                        knife away from themselves. The paper is held in place on all four corners by twisted string.
                        This method is good for figurative openwork patterns. Because the stencils are so thin and
                        finely cut, there is concern that they will tear and be ruined in the dyeing process.</p>

                    <p>Itoire is used to prevent tearing, by peeling the two layers of paper apart and reinforcing
                        fragile sections with thread held together by persimmon tannin, then pulling the two layers back
                        together. The last step is to blow on the strips to rid the paper of any excess persimmon
                        tannin. If itoire is not done correctly, the entire katagami may be ruined, so this process
                        requires extra care and sensitivity.</p>
                    <p>
                        Usage:
                        Katagami stencils were used to dye textiles in the Edo period. Ukiyoe prints (“pictures of the
                        floating world”) often show people wearing clothes with patterns that seem to be dyed using
                        katagami. Three of the main miniature (komon) patterns were samé, toshi, and gyogi. These
                        patterns were extremely detailed and used for kamishimo, which were matching sets of stiff
                        shouldered vests and hakama trousers. All different kinds of people in the ukiyoe prints wore
                        these patterned clothing, from samurai to kabuki actors, to regular townspeople. Textiles
                        created with katagami patterns were popular at the time.</p>
                    <p>Nowadays, katagami stencils are sold as artwork, hand fans or used to decorate Japanese screens
                        or doors.</p>
                    <p>Japanese Influence on Vienna Textile Design:
                        Katagami stencils were a major influence to Western European graphic designers in the nineteenth
                        century. While numerous sheets of katagami paper was layered to form the stencil’s motifs and
                        patterns, each individual sheet alone created an abstract design. These stencils became popular
                        among Vienna Secession artists, who were inspired by the abstract shapes created by the
                        individual separate sheet (that they mistakenly thought were intentionally abstract). The
                        stencils were also used as teaching materials at the school attached to the museum
                        (Kunstgewerbeschule), and students could see them after class. Katagami was used to learn space
                        composition with simple elements, by not only Secession artists but also students.</p>

                    <p>Katagami had influence on textile designs in Vienna Workshops, a representation design enterprise
                        in Austria. The most common motifs were floral or floral combined with butterflies or little
                        birds. (The stencil featured here has a floral motif). The Vienna Workshops’ textile designers
                        were influenced both by the styling of the nature motifs in the katagami as well as their
                        positioning and composition. Textile designers created many designs with forms of flowers and
                        leaves that resembled the katagami stencils. Common representations of floral motifs included
                        chrysanthemums, cherry blossoms, plums, irises, or camellias. The composition of plants on a
                        grid or in geometric figures definitely closely resembled katagami as well. While it may seem
                        that the colorful Viennese textiles were opposite from the simple Japanese designs, it is clear
                        that the Vienna Workshop artists were inspired by katagami, both with the patterns (floral and
                        nature related) and composition (grid-like and geometric).</p>

                    <p>Collections in Europe:
                        Katagami became popular in Europe at the end of the 19th century, and the
                        patterns influenced European art and decoration. The MAK (Museum of Applied Arts) in Vienna,
                        Austria, has over 8,000 Katagami in its collection, which is the most extensive collection in
                        the world. Specifically, the Heinrich von Siebold collection was one of the largest Japanese art
                        collections in Europe at the time, and the MAK inherited the collection in 1907. In 2018, over
                        600 detailed katagami data sheets were documented into the online database of the MAK.</p>
