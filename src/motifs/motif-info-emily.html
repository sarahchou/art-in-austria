                <p>Plaid (Pattern): Plaid​, also known as “tartan” consists of horizontal and vertical lines of multiple
                    colorsthat intersect to form squares of various colors. Plaid has its roots in Scottish cultureand
                    was often worn in distinct color patterns to represent different Scottish clans. Theterms “plaid”
                    and “tartan” became synonymous when the pattern was introduced in bothEuropean and American culture,
                    initially through Scottish immigrants and later throughfashion trends. Today, the plaid pattern can
                    be spotted at nearly any large clothing storeand it continues to be a popular style. </p>
                <p>Origins: The oldest dating record of a plaid textile is said to be dated back to 8th century
                    BC,belonging to a man of caucasian descent who was found buried in western China.Although that is
                    the oldest dating record, the cultural origins of plaid are more oftenassociated with Scotland. The
                    Scottish wore this textile in clothing with initially little colorvariety since resources were
                    scarce. As time passed and resources became moreavailable through means of trade, different Scottish
                    clans began to dress in specificcolor schemes of plaid. Plaid became an integral part of Scottish
                    culture and laterproved to be a symbol for national pride. </p>
                <p>Politics: During Scotland’s time of rebellion against the English
                    monarchy, plaid become thepattern of the Scottish military uniform. At the time, a political group
                    in Scotland was theJacobites, who were looking to have the House of Stuart rule over England,
                    Scotland,and Ireland. The Jacobites faced the British in the Battle of Culloden, which took placein
                    the Scottish Highlands. The Jacobites lost to the British, who then held the throne asthe House of
                    Hanover. As the Hanovers were now ruling over England, Scotland andIreland, they wanted to put an
                    end to the Jacobites and keep their place on the throne.In order to do this they had to gain control
                    over the Scottish clan scene, one way ofwhich was by outlawing the classic plaid pattern that they
                    all wore. As a result, the plaidpattern was outlawed for almost a century. After the ban had been
                    lifted, plaid becamesymbolic of the unity and pride of Scotland. It also became a popular textile in
                    Britishroyal attire, creating a gesture of peace between them and Scotland. </p>
                <p>Fashion: Scottish immigrants brought the pattern of plaid with them and it became a populartextile
                    for many fashion brands. In America, it became a popular pattern thatlumberjacks would sport. In
                    more modern times, plaid became an integral part of thepunk fashion scene, where its embodiment of
                    rebellion can still be seen today.</p>
                <p>Color Development: The plaid color pallet has developed over time, mainly in relation to the
                    resources
                    thatwere available to those creating the textile. Before chemical dyes were around,vegetable dyes
                    were used to produce plaid patterns that over time, often had light orfaded looking colors as a
                    result of the dyes reacting to sunlight. Once chemical dyeswere introduced, much darker colors
                    became a commonality in the plaid textiles. Themost common dark colors of blue, black, and green
                    were used as this time and referredto as “modern” colors. Currently, plaid is mostly being produced
                    for consumerism. As aresult, there is a wide color pallet that encompasses both “modern” colors and
                    moreancient colors. These pallets have been referred to as “muted” colors, but someattempts to mimic
                    vegetable dyes have left plaid patterns not very distinguishable as thecolors are of a similar hue.
                    Overall, many of the traditional color pallet variations are stillseen in plaid today, but the
                    evolution of then has mostly been driven by the resourcesavailable.</p>
