      <h3>Snake Game</h3>

      <p>When tasked with designing the facade of Ars Electronica, our group decided to recreatethe classic arcade game
        Snake. We wanted to create something that included user interaction,and a game seemed to be the most interesting
        and complex option. To play the game,passersby use the terminal to control a snake character, who travels around
        the screen andgrows as he eats apples. The game has simple rules and is easy to learn, meaning thateverybody can
        quickly learn how to play and can enjoy watching. Furthermore, the game isiconic and easily recognizable and it
        evokes feelings of nostalgia in those playing and thosewatching. We wanted it to be a fun experience for
        everyone whether they’re directly involved orjust a spectator, everyone can get invested.We have two states that
        can be activated, one is the Game State where the user canplay as a snake and eat apples to grow bigger while
        trying to avoid colliding with itself. Theother state is for when no one is playing the game where many snakes
        travel random directionsacross the screen. We wanted to make the idle state and fun and engaging piece to look
        at,reminiscent of their youth with lots of colors and high energy motion. We also chose to have astartup screen
        of sorts to the game where the letters to Snake “snakes” on the facade, tointroduce the game in case there are
        some who are unfamiliar. We hope that it’s an entertainingexperience for everyone as they relax during the night
        and enables them to travel back tochildhood.</p>

      <h3>Fish Bowl</h3>

      <p>Slowly rising in water level, the facade of Ars Electronica becomes a Fish Bowl. Once the tankis full of water,
        fish appear and swim around, exploring their surroundings. Viewers are able tointeract with Fish Bowl by
        stepping into a designated interaction space, creating bubbles withtheir footsteps and feeding the fish by
        jumping. Playing with Fish Bowl mirrors the experience ofinteracting with real fish in a bowl, where the fish
        are just as curious about you as you are aboutthem.Ars Electronica is visible from almost the entire riverbank
        in the center of Linz. Since thebuilding is visible from so far away, we wanted to create an entity that could
        engage viewersfrom an equally great distance, with a recognizable and familiar motion. By creating a fish
        bowlbeside the river, where the fish’s reflections swim in the
        Danube, the fish move beyond thefacade and swim into the community</p>

      <h3>Stress Box</h3>
      <h5>By: Sarah Chou, Kira Martin</h5>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kWK2VFAD2R8" frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>Our façade design was inspired by screensavers and the moving, bouncing DVD logo (see
        <a href="https://bouncingdvdlogo.com">here</a>). We created
        an emulation of that using rectangles on the windows of the Ars Electronica building. Each of the four walls has
        a different colored “ball” that “bounces” at a randomly chosen velocity. The point of this project was to create
        a cycle of anticipation and gratification for when the ball aligns perfectly in a corner of the wall. Upon
        collision, a “celebration” happens creating a feeling of satisfaction. Thecycle then repeats itself. The concept
        is to take away the immediate gratification of an ‘action/output’ that so much of technology has today. A decade
        ago, DVD was the most common way to watch movies. Technology was at the stage where users hadto exercise
        patience when waiting for an action (such as fast forwarding or rewinding). Patience is truly a virtue that is
        lost due to the decreased attention span of today’s generation. Technology responds so immediately torequests
        that the user no longer has to wait. When viewers are watching Stress Box, they may feel anxious when awaiting
        the ‘perfect collision’. Eachbounce off of the wall comes so close to the corner but misses it by a hair. When
        the celebration finally occurs, the viewer may finally feel fulfilled, only to immediately feel a loop of
        anticipation for future celebrations.</p>

      <h3>Digital Vanitas</h3>
      <h5>By: Morgan Chemidlin, Fiona Gridley, Caroline Hegg</h5>

    </div>
    <p>Our initial idea was to program the façade in a way that would give it "life," playing with the boundary between
      animate and inanimate. While there are many ways to give life tosomething, we were interested in conveying it
      through abstracted physiological functions. We played around with different ideas on which functions to convey
      (i.e. "lungs" expanding and contracting, a "digestion" sequence, etc). We quickly settled on creating a central
      "heart" that would pump color throughout the facade in the form of "veins." Not only is the heart the center of
      life, it also lends itself well to an interesting visual depiction on the façade. We also wanted to play around
      with the idea of cell automata & the "game of life" animations. They fit into the theme of bodily life forces, and
      provided another interesting spectacle on the façade. We debated about how to make the two scenes merge or
      interact with each other, as we didn't want them to behave independent of each other, but suggest a narrative. We
      ended up developing a narrative where a central organ pulses out colors through channels that wrap around the
      building, and after a period of time, a viral "cell" attacks the central organ and corrupts the channels. The
      façade then breaks out into calculated invasion of cell automata before returning to the heart.By giving the
      building façade life, and then promptly attacking it and breaking it down, the viewer is introduced to an
      abstracted idea of the vanitas, a "symbolic work of art showing the transience of life." This idea of life and
      death are applied to the building and asks the view to consider what the deterioration of a structure looks like
      and means, and how it compares to that of a living being. Digital Vanitas is both a visually compelling narrative
      and a sort of memento mori, reminding us of the fragility of life, both organic and artificial.</p>

      <h3>Austauschstadt (Exchange City)</h3>
      <h5>By: Arielle Bishop, Kriti Gurubacharya, Maggie Van Nortwick</h5>

      <p>This work was inspired by the emerging technologies of virtual, augmented, andmixed reality. Our piece operates
        at the intersection of traditional sculpture and these new mediums by both occupying a space and transforming
        it. In an effort to spark a dialogue on globalization, the Ars Electronica Center’s facade servesas a portal
        between communities, dropping a cubic piece of space from another city into the heart of Linz. Through this, an
        observer can connect tothe current experience of another human being in that very moment, yet in a completely
        differentgeographical and sociopolitical circumstance.The creators are 3 students from Northeastern University,
        located in Boston, Massachusetts. We are all thrilled to have had the opportunity to spend some time in Linz and
        create a piece of artfor this community.</p>
